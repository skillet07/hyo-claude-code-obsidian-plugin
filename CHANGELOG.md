# Changelog

## 0.4.0 — Claude Code + Codex

### Added

- **Multi-provider architecture** — Hyo now registers Claude Code and Codex behind provider-neutral runtime, event, history, and UI contracts. Claude remains the default; changing the default affects new tabs only, and every tab keeps an immutable provider identity.
- **Official stable Codex app-server integration** — Codex uses the stdio JSONL/JSON-RPC `initialize` / `initialized`, thread, turn, item, account, model, skill, and rate-limit APIs. Hyo does not enable experimental APIs and does not fall back to `codex exec`.
- **Codex streaming and tools** — assistant text, reasoning, plans, token/context updates, warnings/errors, command execution, file changes, MCP/dynamic tools, web search, images, sleep, and subagent collaboration activity are normalized into the existing Hyo chat UI. Current stable `collabToolCall` singular IDs/status and the CLI 0.144.1 legacy `collabAgentToolCall` shape are both supported in live events and history.
- **Codex interaction surfaces** — parallel inline approvals/questions keyed by request id, full provider-advertised approval decisions and policy amendments, streamed/final plans and reasoning summaries, review transitions and warnings, interrupt, history loading/renaming, stable resume, compact, structured skill invocation, account rate limits, and provider-scoped buffering/request routing.
- **Provider-safe PDFs** — Claude keeps native inline PDF blocks; Codex PDFs are written byte-for-byte to Hyo's attachment directory and sent as local document paths because app-server does not accept inline document data.
- **Codex authentication** — existing CLI authentication is reused. Hyo can also start and cancel official ChatGPT browser or device-code login flows and display account state without storing provider passwords or API keys.
- **Codex safety controls** — new Codex settings default to `on-request`, `workspace-write`, and network off. Read-only and danger-full-access modes are available, with an explicit warning before full access is saved.
- **Generated protocol bindings** — stable bindings are pinned to Codex CLI `0.144.1`, bigint wire declarations are normalized to JavaScript numbers, and `npm run codex:check-types` regenerates in a temporary directory to detect committed drift without modifying the repository.
- **Opt-in real subagent smoke** — `npm run smoke:codex` requires `HYO_CODEX_SMOKE=1` plus a caller-supplied fixture, uses read-only/no-network stable app-server calls, fails safe on approvals/questions, and requires spawn evidence plus either a completed wait/close call or an actual terminal agent status. It interrupts on failure and is excluded from normal tests so quota is never spent accidentally.
- **Required release gate** — `npm run verify` runs typecheck, the complete Vitest suite, binding drift detection, production build, and whitespace/error-marker checks through `git diff --check`.

### Compatibility and migration

- The plugin id remains `hyo-plugin`, the desktop-only requirement is unchanged, and the release identity is now **Hyo - Claude Code & Codex for Obsidian**.
- Existing flat Claude settings migrate into the Claude provider section without converting Claude sessions or changing the default provider. Existing Claude transport, permissions, agents, plan review, usage/context, recovery, attachments, voice, and history behavior remain supported.
- Codex runtime support requires stable CLI `0.144.1` or newer. Reproducible generated bindings require the pinned `0.144.1` generator.

### Verification status

- Automated coverage exercises provider isolation, runtime lifecycle, parallel request ownership/cancellation, streaming and history mapping, binary PDF routing, structured skills, auth/model/rate-limit surfaces, safety defaults, version enforcement, official native and npm Windows command paths, binding comparison/cleanup, JSONL framing, smoke opt-in, and collaboration-event assertions.
- `npm run smoke:codex` is intentionally operator-run because it uses a real account and quota. The packaged Obsidian release matrix for macOS, Linux, and Windows is also operator-run. Neither is claimed as manually completed here.

## 0.3.11

### Fixes
- **Context ring could show 200K on a brand-new Sonnet 5 tab, then correctly show 1M after closing and reopening it** — the CLI reports a more conservative context figure on a freshly-started session (`--session-id`) than on a resumed one (`--resume`), same account, same model. This wasn't just cosmetic: auto-compact is driven by this number, so a fresh tab could trigger unnecessary compaction near 160K instead of the real ~1M ceiling. The displayed/enforced ceiling is now clamped to never drop below what's already known true for the model, so a conservative early report can't cost you context.
- **Permission mode picker (status bar dropdown) still offered the old "default" value** — missed in the 0.3.9 fix. Selecting "Ask first" from the status bar would silently reintroduce the exact CLI-mismatch bug 0.3.9 fixed. Now uses "manual" throughout.

## 0.3.10

### Fixes
- **AskUserQuestion answers were rejected outright** — answering a question box failed with a schema validation error, because Hyo only sent the answers back and dropped the required `questions` field. The CLI rejects any response to AskUserQuestion that doesn't echo the original questions alongside the answers. Fixed.

## 0.3.9

### Fixes
- **Permission prompts and AskUserQuestion stopped working after a Claude Code CLI update** — the CLI renamed its `default` permission mode to `manual`. Hyo was still sending the old value, which the current CLI rejects, breaking the whole permission/question-prompt flow. Existing installs are migrated automatically.
- **"Always Allow" wasn't actually persisting** — clicking Always Allow only granted the permission for that one running session; it was gone the moment you opened a new tab or restarted Obsidian. Grants now save to `.claude/settings.local.json` so they actually stick.

## 0.3.4

### Features
- **Attached vault files now include the full path** — when you use "Attach current file", Claude receives the vault-relative path (e.g. `02 Projects/My Note.md`) not just the filename. Makes it possible for Claude to locate, update, or reference the file without you having to say where it lives.
- **AskUserQuestion UI** — when Claude uses the AskUserQuestion tool, questions now appear as interactive UI with option buttons and free-text input. Claude waits for your answer before continuing (previously it steamrolled through without pausing).
- **Plan mode review** — ExitPlanMode now shows the full plan as formatted markdown with Approve and Reject buttons. EnterPlanMode auto-approves silently.
- **Auto-naming conversations** — new conversations are automatically named based on the first exchange.

### Fixes
- **Usage monitor reliability** — improved credential caching and faster recovery when the usage API is slow or temporarily unavailable. Added fallback when `.credentials.json` is absent (e.g. fresh installs or Claude CLI not yet authenticated).
- **Browse buttons in settings use native file picker** — Browse buttons now open the system file dialog (Electron native) instead of a web input, matching OS conventions.

## 0.2.0

### New: Voice Mode
- **Talk to Claude, hear responses read aloud** — full conversational voice powered by ElevenLabs. Speech-to-text (you speak) + text-to-speech (Hyo speaks).
- **Voice toggle in status bar** — click to switch between text and voice mode. Per-tab, so different conversations can use different modes.
- **Settings: ElevenLabs API key, voice picker, playback speed, auto-speak toggle** — configure once in Hyo settings, voices load from your ElevenLabs account.
- **Streaming TTS with markdown stripping** — responses are cleaned of formatting before speech, and audio streams via ElevenLabs Flash v2.5 for lower latency.
- **Playback controls** — pause, resume, stop, replay last response, and adjustable speed (1×–2×).

### Fixes
- **Auto-generate conversation titles** — setting now properly wired to the session manager.

## 0.1.11

### Fixes
- **"Attach current file" now actually sends the file** — files attached via the paperclip → "Attach current file" were showing as chips in the UI but silently dropped before sending. Root cause: missing `fileType` field on the attachment object, which caused it to be filtered out during message assembly. Fixed.

## 0.1.10

### Fixes
- **Past sessions now found on Windows** — session lookup tries multiple path normalisations to find sessions regardless of how Windows APIs return the vault path.
- **Diagnostic logging** — console now shows which directories are checked when looking for past sessions.

## 0.1.9

### Fixes
- **Past conversations now work on Windows and non-ASCII paths** — the project directory hash has been rewritten to match Claude Code's exact algorithm (`replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, "-")` + truncation with hash suffix for long paths). The old code only replaced forward slashes, which meant Windows backslash paths produced a completely wrong directory lookup — every Windows user saw zero past sessions. Also fixes paths containing dots, underscores, or spaces (e.g. `john.doe`, `My Vault`).
- **Symlink and Unicode path resolution** — the plugin now resolves symlinks (`realpathSync`) and normalises Unicode to NFC before hashing, matching Claude Code's internal behaviour. Fixes session lookup failures for vaults on iCloud, Dropbox aliases, or paths with accented characters on macOS.
- **"Always allow" button now works** — the permission response was sending `behavior: "allow_always"` which isn't in Claude Code's schema (only `"allow"` and `"deny"` are valid). Claude silently rejected it. Fixed to send `behavior: "allow"` with an `updatedPermissions` array that adds a session-level allow rule for the tool, plus `decisionClassification: "user_permanent"` — matching how Claude Code's own terminal UI handles it.

### Features
- **One-click session recovery** — when a session is poisoned by an orphaned thinking block (output cap mid-stream truncation), a recovery banner appears on the error message. Click "Recover session and continue" to surgically remove the corrupt entries from the JSONL file and resume. Your last attempted message is prefilled in the input.

## 0.1.8

### Fixes
- **Configurable output token cap** — added a "Max output tokens" setting (Settings → Hyo Plugin → Advanced) that's passed to Claude Code via `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`. Default is now 64000 (up from CC's 32000). The previous low cap could truncate large single-shot generations (big HTML files, complex code) and leave an orphaned signed `thinking` block in the session, poisoning every subsequent message with a `messages.N.content.M: thinking blocks cannot be modified` API error. Bumping the default prevents the cap from firing in normal use. Lower to 32000 in settings if using Opus models, which max out at 32k output.

## 0.1.7

### Fixes
- **Accurate context window ring** — usage now read from individual assistant events (not aggregated results), with subagent events filtered out; ratios no longer double-count
- **Auto-detect model context window** — picks up from `modelUsage` so 1M-context models show the correct ceiling
- **Strip inline `<thinking>` tags** — Claude 4.7's adaptive thinking occasionally emits `<thinking>…</thinking>` as text inside a normal response; these are now stripped at render so internal reasoning doesn't leak into the chat
- **Default agent no longer leaks between users** — `data.json` is no longer tracked in git and a migration clears stale `defaultAgent` if no matching agent file exists on disk
- **Past sessions open with your default agent** — previously opened with the generic "Default" regardless of settings

### Features
- **PDF attachments** — PDFs sent as native document blocks, no text extraction
- **Excel/XLSX attachments** — workbooks parsed to CSV using `exceljs` (avoids the SheetJS vulnerability path)
- **Large file attachment routing** — text attachments over ~5k tokens are saved to disk and Claude reads them on demand via the Read tool; messages stay lean and the content benefits from prompt caching on subsequent turns
- **Attachment size on chips** — chips show estimated token size; large (reference-mode) files have a dashed border so routing is visible before sending
- **Auto-cleanup of old attachments** — files older than 1 day are swept on plugin load
- **Auto-compact continuation** — after an auto-compact, Hyo nudges the CLI with "Please continue." so the conversation resumes instead of stalling

## 0.1.6
- **Settings refresh without restart** — changing settings now updates the chat panel immediately (no restart required)
- **Auto-detect CLI path** — new button in settings finds your Claude installation automatically
- **Default agent setting** — choose which agent to use for new conversations in settings
- **Per-field saved indicator** — "✓ Saved" now appears next to the field that changed, not just at the top of settings
- **Fixed agent picker** — removed hardcoded personal defaults; "Default" option is now a clean generic entry
- **Fixed BRAT version mismatch** — manifest version now correctly matches release tag
